2. How Flutter & Dart Code Gets Compiled To Native App?
    
    + Flutter Code Compilation:
        - Flutter simply compile that Dart code to native code for these different platforms (Android, iOS, Web Apps, Desktop Appss).
        - As a result, you get real app spit out with highly optimized hight performance code that's based your code.

    + Flutter Does NOT use platform Primitives:
        - Flutter doesn not compile your code to some native equivlence or native alternative.
        - Instead flutter ships with its own engine which controls the entire scree, everything the user sees and renders every pixel on its own and that gives Flutter a lot of control and a lot of flexibility.

2. What is flutter?
    + Flutter: is tool that allows you to build native cross-platform (iOS, Android) apps with one programming language and codebase.

    + Flutter is combination of 2 major things: 
        1. A SDK (Software Development Kit): a collection of tools that allows you to write one codebase or use one codebase with one programming language.
        - Tools to compile your code to native machine code + develop with ease.
        
        2. A Framework/ Widget Library: Re-usable UI building blocks (= widgets), utility functions, packages.

        3. Dart? : is focused on frontend (mobile apps, web) user interface (UI) development.

            - Object-oriented & Strongly Typed
            - Syntax is like a mixuter of JavaScript, Java, C#
